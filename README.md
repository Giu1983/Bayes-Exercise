I used React.js library to build the application in which I placed the code to catch and display the series's name, series's start and end date. I made different component for the different functionalities: 
I used create- react-app to build the app and then I made two different folder (component and containers) for the different files in which I wrote the code: 
- In product.js I placed the series's data; 
- in DataFilter.js. I wrote the code to filter the data; 
- in VisibleSeries.js I wrote the code to display the data
- in FetchData.js I wrote the code to fetch the series's data as series's name, start date and end date. 

At the end there has been some technical issues and unfortunately I didn't have time to fixed them, but I hope this code is enough to show my IT knowledge and willing to learn.
